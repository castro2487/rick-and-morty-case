## Rick & Morty QL - Rick And Morty GraphQL App

This is a client application which consumes the Rick and Morty API.
It uses [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for all the data fetching and state management.

The project was written in TypeScript.
I've used [graphql-codegen](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) to create type definitions automatically.
Also, configured Apollo to show the GraphQL errors and warnings as explained [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/apollo-config/).

* [Apollo-Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
* [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/)

To run it in development mode:

### `npm install`

### `npm run dev`

### The Rick and Morty API

This is a really cool public API which provides you the characters, locations and episodes. It has both Rest and GraphQL implementations. So, you can use it to learn and explore new techniques, libraries etc.
