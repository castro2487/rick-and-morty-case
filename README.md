## The Case
Using the API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/

We want to see all characters with the following information:

## How?
How do we want you to do it? We don't care, make it in React, Vue, Symfony, Zend, Slim, etc... 
Make it in the framework(s) of your choice. 
Just make sure it is something you're proud of and shows us your knowledge and abilities!

## Bonus points
Want to impress us a bit more? Here are some tips to do so
- Dockerize it
- Use awesome techniques
- Make it (the code) look pretty
- Explain to us in detail how a plumbus is made
